    press 'Crtl + f' & write "aliascontent" & press "find next" -> then after finding complete -> go down in "$aliascontent" -> where you see 
    or if you won't see then -> this is it, copy this ($aliascontents .= '<li><a href="'.str_replace('.conf','',$file).'/">'.str_replace('.conf','',$file).'</a></li>';)
